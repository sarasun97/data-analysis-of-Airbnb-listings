## Project Motivation
This is my first project for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program. I will briefly analyze three different areas (# of listings, price, and amenities) of listings on Airbnb using the CRISP-DM process.
1. How many rooms are available in each of the communities? How many entire apartments and private rooms are there in each community?
2. What are the differences between the amenities provided by the entire apartment and the private room?
3. How much does one person have to pay in each community? Is an entire apartment more expensive?
4. How much more does a person need to pay to book a private room with a private bathroom?

The dataset is available on [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), an independent, non-commercial website that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world

## Results
A summary for the four business questions is as follow: 
1. Among the 25 neighborhoods listed, Dorchester, Downtown, Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, and Brightonâ€™s available rooms are in the top 5. Downtown is not very big, but the density of rooms is enormous, while the other 4 neighborhoods are large in terms of area. The distribution of entire apartments and private rooms varies greatly in each community.
2. Entire apartments provide more amenities, but if you are looking for rooms that provide free street parking, maybe a private room is a better choice.
3. In different communities, the average price comparison between the entire apartments and private rooms is very different. The entire apartments are more expensive in 14 communities, and the private rooms are more expensive in 11 communities.
4. Guests need to pay $42.19 more to book a private room with a private bathroom. If we focus on the average price per person, a guest needs to pay $9.4 more.
